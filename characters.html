	<h3>Ace</h3>
	<div class="col">
		<img class="c2" src="images/cha_ace.webp" alt="Ace McNacho">
		<div class="c10">
			<p>
			    Ace is a private detective bot and the only one of his kind. He takes pride in his creator, Thomas Edison IV, despite acting rather embarrassed around him. 
				Ace is snide, sassy and sarcastic. He firmly believes he's always the smartest in the room, and as irritating as that can be, it's difficult to argue against his case.

	<h3>Dant</h3>
	<div class="col">
		<img class="c2" src="images/cha_dant.webp" alt="Dant">
		<div class="c10">
			<p>
				Dant is a diplomat bot, holding panels about environmental issues. He specializes in aquaculture, nature, and tradition (which he actually gets his name from)! Since he's a young bot, his speech patterns are a bit disjointed, yet he's soft-spoken, polite, and surprisingly empathetic.

	<h3>Castilles</h3>
	<div class="col">
		<img class="c2" src="images/cha_cast.webp" alt="Castilles">
		<div class="c10">
			<p>
				Castilles is a racing robot built by Adelpha, and he's new to the town of Limbersdale. Despite his shrill voice and not-too-solid sense of direction, he has a kind disposition and cheery demeanour, and he's always willing to help.

	<h3>Adelpha</h3>
	<div class="col">
		<img class="c2" src="images/cha_adelpha2.webp" alt="Dant">
		<div class="c10">
			<p>
				Adelpha is the creator and upkeeper of Castilles. She visits his place once a week to make sure he's in good working condition. She is pragmatic and often butts heads with Ace, and has a tendency to some off as cold sometimes. But she has a softer side that only truly shines around the people she cares the most about.
