	<h2>Season 2 Releases July 2022!</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		Hi, people! It's Lei. Just wanted to give a quick progress update on how things are going. I know you're excited, and this is as good a time as any to get hyped - Season 2 of Robotrio is coming out later this year, after all!
	</p>
	<p>
		As a quick progress report, we're almost completely finished on the audio side of things. 
		The trick here is getting the art done, as that's the most time-consuming part of the process, but we're doing well on time so far. With the rate we're going at, we should be able to finish production around a month or so before episodes start releasing.
	</p>
	<p>
    In addition, there is a special project we've been working with on the side. I won't say what it is just yet (wait until later this month!), but you'll be able to find it if you look closely at one of our tweets.
	</p>
