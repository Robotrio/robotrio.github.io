	<h2>810NICLE Day World Primer</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		810NICLE Day is a massive annual virtual event for and by fans of the BIONICLE franchise, with multiple figures from the franchise's films, 
		comic book line, music, and more participating directly or indirectly in the event. 
		This year introduced a new segment, <em>Beyond BIONICLE</em>, which showcases original projects by members of the BIONICLE community, 
		highlighting the creativity unleashed when inspired creators go beyond the series that brought them together. 
	</p>
	<p>
		2023's event centered on two projects: Robotrio and <a href="https://www.hex.studio/" target="_blank">Colony</a>. 
		For the former showcase, series creator and director Lei Hart presented a 5-minute video segment that introduces viewers to the world and themes that Robotrio showcase, 
		providing new project announcements and additional series lore for existing fans without spoiling newcomers.
	</p>
		The two announcements, which start at 4:30 in the video, look to expand both the world and media Robotrio presents. The first is a visual novel that adapts the events of the first season, 
		featuring the decision-based gameplay and branching storylines that the medium excels in. The second is a spin-off focused in a different region of the world of Robotrio, with a new cast and a societal focus. 
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
		The second <em>Beyond BIONICLE</em> creation, Colony, revolves around an insectoid universe and roleplaying game developed by Hexahedron Studios and headed by Red Star Games member Muircat. 
		If you're a fan of BIONICLE, Robotrio, or tabletop RPGs, we encourage you to visit the project's website at <a href="https://www.hex.studio/">Hexahedron Studios</a>.
